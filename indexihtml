        <p> The Solar System, a vast expanse of space that contains one star-the Sun and all the other countless bodies orbiting it.
            This includes the eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets and many asteroids, comets, debris and icy matter.
            In the solar sytem there are two belts: the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the Kuprion belt that surrounds the whole solar sytem with asteroids and other bodies.
            The eight planets in order from the Sun are: 
            <li>
                Mercury
            </li>
            <li>
               Venus
            </li>
            <li>
                Earth
            </li>
            <li>
                Mars
            </li>
            <li>
